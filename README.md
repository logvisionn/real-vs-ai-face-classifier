## Real vs. AI-Generated Face Classifier

A PyTorch-based binary classification project that distinguishes between real human faces and AI-generated ones. Includes Grad-CAM interpretability, a Streamlit interface, and Docker-based deployment. Suitable for portfolio/CV.

---

### üöÄ Project Highlights (CV-Friendly)

- **Binary classification** using transfer learning (ResNet18/MobileNetV2) on real vs. AI faces.
- **Data pipeline**: Automated scripts for downloading and preprocessing CelebA (real) and ‚Äúthispersondoesnotexist‚Äù (AI) images.
- **Model interpretability**: Integrated Grad-CAM to visualize model attention.
- **Deployment**: Interactive Streamlit web app with image upload and live inference.
- **Containerization**: Dockerized app for easy deployment.
- **CI/CD (optional)**: Sample GitHub Actions workflow for linting, unit tests, and Docker build.
